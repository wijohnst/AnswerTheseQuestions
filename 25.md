A truth table is a way to write out all possible outcomes of a given thing.
It's a giant grid with inputs on one side and inputs on the other with boxes
showing the outcome within the grid.

Here's an example showing if adding the numbers is greater than *or equal to* 5


|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | F | F | F | T |
| 2 | F | F | T | T |
| 3 | F | T | T | T |
| 4 | T | T | T | T |
