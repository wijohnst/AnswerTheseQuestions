A state machine is an object that keeps track of it's state and states that it
is allowed to move to from a given state.

As an example if I have a car, I can start the car if it's off. Once it's on I
can't tell the car to start again because it's already started. And I can put it
in drive if it's started, but if it's off and I try to tell it to drive it will
reject that command because it's not in the right state to do so.
